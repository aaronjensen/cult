# Features

* Detects gulpfile extension and calls gulp accordingly. 
* Watches gulpfile and reloads gulp on change.
* Supports gulpfile written in JavaScript, CoffeeScript, IcedCoffeeScript, CoffeeScriptRedux and LiveScript.

# Usage

Install everything as you would do with gulp.
```bash
$ npm install -g gulp cult 
$ npm install --save-dev coffee-script gulp
```

Create your gulpfile in your favourite language and call cult.
```bash
$ vim gulpfile.coffee
$ cult -w <task> <othertask>
$ # will call gulp <task> <othertask> --require coffee-script/register
```

Just remove the `-w` parameter if you don't your gulpfile to be watched.

### For `gulpfile` split across multiple files

If your `gulpfile` is split across multiple files, add something similar 
to this to your `watch` task to reload on any gulp file changes:

```coffee
gulp.watch(['gulp/**'], -> exec('touch gulpfile.coffee'))
```
